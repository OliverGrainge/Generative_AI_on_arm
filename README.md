# Generative AI on ARM

Welcome to the **Generative AI on ARM** course! This course focuses on optimizing generative AI workloads for ARM architectures, guiding you through hands-on labs and practical implementations. There are two labs on this course. Lab1 that focusses on mobile devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5 and lab2 that works with Graviton based servers. In each, lab you will learn how to optimize generative AI inference by harnessing the powerful intrinsics of ARM devices. 

## Getting Started

To begin the lab, follow these steps:

1. **Run the setup script**  
   Open a terminal in the project directory and execute the setup script:  
   
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Open up the course material**  
   The course material is provided as Jupyter notebooks. To access the content, activate the virtual environment and launch Jupyter Lab:
   
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate

   jupyter lab 
   ```
